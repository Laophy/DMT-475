        Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant
        otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine, with diets based
        on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the Mustelidae
        family, which also includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines,
        among other animals.
