            David Gonzalez, The Cinematic Reel</p>
            
            <p><em>"As heartbreakingly faithful as it is riveting and suspenseful, The Last of Us is a triumph that ends any further debate about the all-time best video game adaptation."</em><br>
            Nick Schager, The Daily Beast</p>
            
            <p><em>"A damn good TV drama in its own right, offering a beautifully-shot character study and plenty of thrills to boot."</em><br>
